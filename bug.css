The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it's easy to introduce errors that cause unexpected behavior if you're not careful with spacing and operator precedence. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px)` works perfectly, but `width:calc(100%-10px)` (missing space) will fail.  Another common mistake is incorrect use of parentheses with nested calculations, leading to misinterpretations of the order of operations.  Unit mismatches (mixing `px`, `em`, `%` without proper conversions) frequently lead to layout issues that are difficult to debug because the browser often doesn't give a precise error message.
